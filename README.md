# autooffbluetooth
A simple Android app to automatically turn off bluetooth if disconnected.

No configuration, should work as-is, no guarentees and might need you to disable battery optimization for the app.

If BT is disconnected and reconnected quickly, the app will avoid disabling unnecessarily.
